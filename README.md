# Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Step 1: Data Preparation

    Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis environment, such as Python with libraries like pandas.
    Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and any other data quality issues.

Step 2: Text Preprocessing

    Preprocess the text data in the "Review" column. This includes tasks like tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming or lemmatization.

Step 3: Sentiment Analysis

    Create a new column in the dataset to store sentiment labels (e.g., "Positive" and "Negative") based on the "Rating" column's values.
    You can use a simple rule: Ratings above 3 are "Positive," and ratings below 3 are "Negative."

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Perform EDA to understand the distribution of positive and negative reviews, visualize the data, and extract insights.

Step 5: Building a Sentiment Classifier

    Split your dataset into a training set and a testing set.
    Build a sentiment classifier using NLP techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
    Train the classifier on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Step 6: Interpretation and Insights

    Analyze the results of your sentiment analysis and draw conclusions about the sentiment of restaurant reviews.
    Identify common positive and negative keywords or phrases in the reviews.

Step 7: Optional - Visualizations

    Create visualizations, such as word clouds or sentiment trend plots, to further illustrate your findings.
